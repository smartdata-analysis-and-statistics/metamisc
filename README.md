This is the official repository of the R package metamisc, which facilitate frequentist and Bayesian meta-analysis of diagnosis and prognosis research studies. It includes functions to  summarize multiple estimates of prediction model discrimination and calibration performance (Debray et al., 2019) <doi:10.1177/0962280218785504>. It also includes functions to evaluate funnel plot asymmetry (Debray et al., 2018) <doi:10.1002/jrsm.1266>. Finally, the package provides functions for developing multivariable prediction models from datasets with clustering (de Jong et al., 2021) <doi:10.1002/sim.8981>
